# Silicon Labs ZigBee firmware builder repository

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Builds here are updated fairly fast after new changes/releases, hence, you can consider them somewhat similar to the difference between Zigbee2MQTT "normal" branch, and dev/edge branch.

This repository contains building tools and firmware releases for the most common ZigBee adapters.

It uses the Silicon Labs Simplicity SDK and proprietary Silicon Labs tools such as the Silicon Labs Configurator (slc) and the Simplicity Commander standalone utility.
